📊 Sales Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project
Welcome to my Sales Analysis Dashboard project! 🚀
This interactive dashboard was built using Power BI to turn raw sales data into meaningful business insights. It helps you explore top-selling products, track trends over time, understand customer behavior, and compare sales performance across different periods.

🧐 What's This Project About?
Running a business without understanding your data is like flying blind. This dashboard solves that by giving you a complete picture of:

📦 Best and worst performing products (by sales, profit, quantity sold)

📈 Sales trends across days, months, and years

💰 How sales relate to profit

🔁 Comparing performance between two custom date ranges

🎯 Promotions and how much discount was really given

🏙️ Where your customers are buying from (sales by city)

📋 And yes, you can dig into individual orders with smart filters!

Whether you're a business analyst, data enthusiast, or someone learning Power BI, this project offers a great starting point.

📐 Data Model Design (Star Schema)
This project uses a star schema to keep things clean and fast.


Main Components:
Fact Table: Stores all transactions (sales, discounts, profit, etc.)

Dimension Tables: Info about products, customers, promotions, and dates

Measure Table: Pre-calculated metrics like quantity sold

Everything is connected to give you flexibility when slicing and filtering data.

🧩 Key Dashboard Features
🔝 Top & Bottom Products
See the top 5 and bottom 5 products across three metrics: sales, quantity sold, and profit.


📅 Sales Trends & Period Comparison
Track how sales change over time — daily, monthly, yearly — and compare any two custom periods side-by-side.



🌍 Location & Promotion Insights
Explore where your customers are buying from with a city map

Understand which promotions drove the most sales and how much discount was given


🧾 Order-Level Drilldown

The table view lets you filter and explore every order in detail.
